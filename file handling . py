first create the file and read the file 
f.read = open ("siva.txt",r)
print(f.read())


create the file and write the file using file handling
f = open("siva.txt","w")
f.write("hello siva")
f = open("siva.txt")
print(f.read())

and we can able to append a file using file handling using (a) and \n is used for break the lines
